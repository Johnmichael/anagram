# anagram

This is the week four code review for the "Intro to Programming" project for Epicodus students.


## Getting Started

Two words are anagrams if they contain the exact same letters in a different order. For example, "ruby" and "bury" are anagrams because they contain the same letters.

This project will either be available for download immediately, or will be available on Github Pages.

After downloading, drag and drop "index.html" onto an empty Google Chrome tab.

### Prerequisites

If you can view this, it is very likely that you already have the prerequisites.

If you can not view this, or are on a mobile browser, I would suggest you accommodate the nearest desktop or laptop computer with an internet connection. For more advanced users, transfer the downloaded content to that computer.

## Specifications

- User inputs two strings, program checks if they are anagrams.

  - Example Input: "cat" and "act".
  - Example Output: True, "cat" and "act" are anagrams.

  - Example Input: "cat" and "can"
  - Example Output: False, "cat" and "can" are not anagrams.

- User inputs strings with punctuation, casing and spacing differences, program ignores.
  - Example Input: "ON!" and "N o"
  - Example Output: True, "on" and "no" are anagrams.

- User inputs string with no letters or vowels, program prevents anagram checking function.
  - Example Input: "12343" and "onetwothreefourthree"
  - Example Output: Please enter a word.
